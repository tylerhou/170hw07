Usage:

1. Put your code in hw07.py like normal.
2. Run with `python3 judger.py`.

These are not the OCF test cases; they are cases that I randomly generated.

There are NO GUARANTEES that

1. These solutions are correct... but the code that found the solutions did pass all test cases on OCF.
2. That solving all of these implies that you will solve all the OCF test cases
3. That an error in any testcase here implies that your code will error on OCF.

Use at your own risk.
